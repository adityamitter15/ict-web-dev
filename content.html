        <h2>Non-communicable Diseases (NCDs):</h2>
        <p>
            NCDs, such as cardiovascular diseases, cancers, chronic respiratory diseases, and diabetes, are responsible for over 70% of global deaths annually.
            Childhood obesity is a significant risk factor for developing NCDs later in life. In 2020, an estimated 39 million children under the age of 5 were overweight or obese.
            In low- and middle-income countries, NCDs account for nearly half of all deaths, with a disproportionate impact on children and young adults.

        <h2>Mental Health:</h2>
        <p>
            Mental health conditions, including depression, anxiety, and developmental disorders, affect around 20% of children and adolescents globally.
            Approximately 1 in 7 children worldwide (up to 14 years old) have experienced mental health issues, with the COVID-19 pandemic exacerbating these challenges.
            Suicide is the fourth leading cause of death among young people aged 15-29 years old.

        <h2>Environmental Risks:</h2>
        <p>
            Air pollution is a major environmental risk factor, contributing to respiratory infections, low birth weight, and other health issues in children.
            In 2020, an estimated 1.8 billion children (up to 16 years old) were exposed to high levels of outdoor air pollution, primarily from fine particulate matter (PM2.5).
            Unsafe water, poor sanitation, and inadequate hygiene practices are responsible for numerous child deaths and illnesses, particularly in low-resource settings.
