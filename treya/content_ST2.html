        <h1>Infectious diseases</h1>

        <h4>HIV</h4>

        <p>
            Infectious diseases remain a significant challenge to global health and wellness, impeding progress toward the Sustainable Development Goal of ensuring good health for all. HIV/AIDS, despite some advancements in prevention and treatment, continues to pose a formidable threat. In 2018 alone, there were an estimated 1.7 million new HIV infections worldwide, with a concerning incidence rate that has shown little improvement since 2015. Particularly alarming is the fact that one in three new HIV infections globally occurs among women aged 15 to 49 in sub-Saharan Africa, highlighting the urgent need for targeted interventions and support for vulnerable populations in this region.

        <h4>Tuberculosis</h4>

        <p>
            TB remains a persistent global health crisis, especially in low- and middle-income countries. Although there has been a decline in TB incidence from 2015 to 2018, with the mortality rate among HIV-negative individuals decreasing, the progress is insufficient to meet the goal of ending the epidemic by 2030. Additionally, the emergence of drug-resistant strains poses a significant challenge to TB control efforts, necessitating innovative approaches and investments in research and development for new treatments and diagnostics.

        </p>

        <h4>Malaria</h4>

        <p>
            Malaria, another major infectious disease, has seen a stagnation in progress after years of significant reductions in global burden. Despite efforts to combat the disease, particularly in endemic regions, malaria incidence has remained relatively unchanged since 2014, indicating a plateau in advancements toward the Sustainable Development Goal target of ending malaria. Sustained investment in vector control measures, access to effective antimalarial drugs, and research into new prevention strategies are essential to reigniting progress and reducing the burden of malaria worldwide. 
        </p>

        <h4>Herpes B</h4>

        <p>
            The success of vaccination campaigns in combating infectious diseases is evident in the case of hepatitis B, where the widespread use of the vaccine has led to a substantial decrease in new chronic infections, especially among children. The decline in chronic hepatitis B virus infections among children under 5 years of age from 4.7% in the pre-vaccine era to 0.9% in 2018 demonstrates the critical role of immunization programs in preventing the spread of infectious diseases and protecting vulnerable populations.
        </p>

        <h4>Neglected Tropical Diseases</h4>

        <p>
            Furthermore, efforts to address neglected tropical diseases (NTDs) have made notable strides in recent years, with a significant reduction in the number of individuals requiring mass or individual treatment and care. This progress, driven by initiatives aimed at eliminating specific NTDs in various countries, underscores the importance of targeted interventions and multisectoral collaboration in tackling infectious diseases that disproportionately affect marginalized communities. However, sustaining and accelerating progress toward the elimination of NTDs will require continued investment in health systems strengthening, access to essential medicines, and community-based interventions to reach the most vulnerable populations worldwide.
