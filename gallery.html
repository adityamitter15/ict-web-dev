            <p>UNICEF is committed to supporting adolescent girls and boys in developing and reaching their full potential. Around the world, UNICEF partners with adolescents to improve the policies, programmes and services that affect their health and well-being. We work with governments in health and other areas – like education; nutrition; gender; child protection; HIV and AIDS; and water, sanitation and hygiene – to increase investments and help countries develop comprehensive plans that address the needs of all adolescents, especially the most marginalized.</p>

            <p>A meta-analysis of international studies comprised of the health records of nearly 1.2 million women found that women who breastfed at some time in their lives were less likely to develop heart disease or stroke and had a lower risk of dying from cardiovascular disease compared to women who did not breastfeed. Over an average follow-up period of 10 years, women who breastfed at some time in their life were 14% less likely to develop coronary heart disease; 12% less likely to suffer strokes; and 17% less likely to die from cardiovascular disease. There were no notable differences in cardiovascular disease risk among women of different ages or according to the number of pregnancies.</p>

            <p>In advance of the 2023 United Nations Water Conference, this Advocacy Spotlight examines the “triple burden” of WASH-related threats facing children at the intersection of access to WASH services, the burden of WASH-related diseases, and climate threats. Through examining the burden of disease from unsafe WASH, we see where the problem is greatest. Through examining access to water and sanitation services, we see where investment is the lowest. Through examining climate threats, we see which countries face the greatest risk to both health and services for children.</p>

            <p>The escalation of hostilities in the Gaza Strip is having a catastrophic impact on children and families. Children are dying at an alarming rate – thousands have been killed and thousands more injured. Around 1.7 million people in the Gaza Strip are estimated to have been internally displaced – half of them children. They do not have enough access to water, food, fuel and medicine. More than 600,000 children are trapped in Rafah alone, with nowhere safe to go. Their homes have been destroyed; their families torn apart.</p>

            <p>In accordance with its mandate to provide guidance to Member States on health policy matters, WHO provides global vaccine and immunization recommendations for diseases that have an international public health impact. National programmes adapt the recommendations and develop national immunization schedules, based on local disease epidemiology and national health priorities. National immunization schedules and number of recommended vaccines vary between countries, with only DTP polio and measles containing vaccines being used in all countries.</p>

            <p>There are 1.3 billion adolescents in the world today, more than ever before, making up 16 per cent of the world’s population. Defined by the United Nations as those between the ages of 10 and 19, adolescents experience a transition period between childhood and adulthood and with it, significant growth and development. As children up to the age of 18, most adolescents are protected under the Convention on the Rights of the Child. Yet, their vulnerabilities and needs are distinctly different from those of children and therefore often remain unaddressed. </p>
