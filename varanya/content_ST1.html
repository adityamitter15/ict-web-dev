                    Immunization is one of the world's most successful and cost-effective health interventions.
                    While vaccination coverage among infants increased, from 72 to 85 to 86 per cent in 2000, 2015 and 
                    2018, respectively, an estimated 19.4 million children did not receive essential vaccines in 
                    their first year of life. In addition, global coverage levels of the pneumococcal conjugate 
                    vaccine, which has the potential to reduce pneumonia significantly, have yet to reach 50% coverage. 
                    Measles is a highly contagious disease, and the 69 per cent coverage of the two-dose vaccine 
                    in 2018 was insufficient to prevent a measles outbreak.
                    The use of the hepatitis B vaccine in infants has reduced the incidence of new chronic hepatitis B infections considerably. 
                    The proportion of children under 5 years of age who became chronically infected fell from 4.7% 
                    in the pre-vaccination era to 0.9 per cent in 2020. Worldwide, the 2020 target of 1 per cent seroprevalence 
                    in children under 5 years of age has been met. Additional efforts for increasing coverage are needed to achieve 
                    the Goal target of 0.1% seroprevalence by 2030.

            <h3>Health Workers</h3>

                A 2020 study shows that the projected global shortage of health workers by 2030 has reduced from 18 million to 10 million.
                Despite the tremendous increase in health workforce globally, regions with the highest burden of disease
                continue to have the lowest proportion of health workforce to deliver health services. According to data from 2014-2021, 
                sub-Saharan Africa continues to have the lowest health worker density, with only 2.3 medical doctors and 12.6 nursing and 
                midwifery personnel per 10,000 population. In contrast, Europe has the highest density of 39.4 doctors per 10,000 population, 
                while North America has 152 nursing and midwifery personnel per 10,000 population.

            <h3>Women Health Care Workers</h3>

                Women are the heart and soul of the health care workforce. They account for 70 per cent of all health workers, 
                90% of nurses and midwives and nearly 75 per cent of community health workers. They are responsible for improving 
                health and survival outcomes for millions of people each day. And they are critical to accelerating progress towards 
                universal access to health care and achieving the SDGs.   
            </p>

                More broadly, UNICEF supports and trains community health workers to provide essential services, prevent the 
                spread of diseases and respond to humanitarian crises. We also work with governments and other development 
                organizations to elevate community health in national agendas. Our approach integrates service delivery across multiple sectors 
                including health and nutrition, early childhood development, social protection, water, sanitation and hygiene.

                But this is not enough. Excellencies, the bottom line is that in order to reach the SDGs, 
                we need to support and invest in community health workers and we need to support and invest in girls 
                and women. This means expanding access to quality education and skills training ensuring equal pay for equal 
                work and providing consistent funds for the tools needed to do the job. In this way, we can build healthier 
                societies and make the SDGs a reality.

                The RCN Foundation (RCNF) supports members of the nursing and midwifery professions who are experiencing 
                financial hardship. It is not necessary have to be a member of the RCN to access funding. Full eligibility criteria 
                and application are both available online. See Hardship Grants on the RCNF website for more details.
                The WHO is supported by other members of the UN family to promote and protect global health. 
                Many health-related matters are addressed by the General Assembly and the Economic and Social Council, 
                as well as through the efforts of the Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS); the work of the 
                United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA) in support of reproductive, adolescent and maternal health; 
                and the health-related activities of the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF).
